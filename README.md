# Reversetagram
### _a content aggregate of images you want_

Reversetagram is a tool designed to make requests for images that you've been wanting but don't necessarily have enough of. Eventually, we'll be feeding these images with their assigned categories into an AI so that it can learn how to make images of its own.
